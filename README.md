# GeneticRaceAI_3

The Goal of this project is to create a learnign AI to navigate tracks produced in GeneticRaceEditor. 

This is far from finished and describing it as a mess would be being kind. 
The last time I worked on this I was struggling to make my neural network learn how to drive. 
Hopefully one day soon Ill manage to get to work. 

Also needs to be updated to the newest GameEngineSFML.
